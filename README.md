# Template Repository
A repository set up with the correct settings from which new repositories should be created.

When a new repository is created appropiate personnel should be added to the appropiate roles under the tab "Collaborators & teams" under "Settings". There should at least be one collaborator with the "Admin"  permission which should be the relevant module owner if it's a module repository or the most relevant developer if it is a repository for a smaller code base. Additional developers should be given the "Write" permission.

Below follows a template of how the README of projects should look like at bare minimum. The contents of the README should be constantly updated when changes relating to it are made.

# Repository Name

## Dependencies

## Installation and setup

A description of how the repository is installed and setup to be executed. Preferably presented in a numbered list format as shown below.
